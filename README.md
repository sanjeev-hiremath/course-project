# course-project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

1) a tidy data set as described below is prepared using the R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data called "CodeBook.md".
